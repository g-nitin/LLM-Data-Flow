# Outputs

This folder houses all the outputs generated during finalizing the recipe benchmarks. It is organized as follows:

- `recipes/`: Contains the final recipes used for the benchmarks.
- `final_recipes_refined/`: Contains the recipes after interactive correction (Step 4).
- `final_recipes_reviewed/`: Contains the recipes after (human) manual review.
- `final_recipes/`: Contains the recipes after the pre-final dataset generation (step 3).
- `outs_24_subset_analysis/`: Outputs from the initial diminishing part (step 2a).
- `outs_24_subsetted_analysis/`: Outputs from the second diminishing part (step 2b).
- `outs_24/`: The 24th iteration of the recipe generation process. It was deemed good enough from the outputs of the procedural text processing (Step 1).
- `zips/`: Contains the zipped versions of all previous outputs after step 1 and step 2 before the 24th iteration.
