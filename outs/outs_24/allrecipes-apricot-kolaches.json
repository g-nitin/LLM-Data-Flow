  "instructions": {
    "1": "To make Filling: Combine apricots and water in heavy saucepan and cook covered over medium heat for 10 minutes or until apricots are soft. Cook UNCOVERED 5 to 10 minutes or until most of the water has been absorbed.",
    "2": "Mash apricots, stir in 2 tablespoons of sugar and let filling cool. Set aside.",
    "3": "To make Dough: Cream butter and cream cheese until fluffy; add 3/4 cup sugar and beat well. Add flour and mix well. Shape dough into ball and chill 1 hour.",
    "4": "Turn dough onto well-floured surface, working with only half the dough. Roll into 1/8 inch thickness and cut into 2 inch squares. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon of apricot filling into the center of the square. Bring four corners to center, pinching to seal.",
    "5": "Bake at 400 degrees F for about 15 minutes. Optional - you may baste with butter halfway thru baking period.",
    "6": "Optional - drizzle LIGHTLY with powdered sugar/milk frosting if you desire sweeter kolaches."
