  "instructions": {
    "1": "Season chicken breast with Montreal steak seasoning. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and pour 1/3 cup hot pepper sauce into the bag. Seal bag and rub hot sauce into chicken. Transfer bag to the refrigerator and marinate for 12 hours or overnight.",
    "2": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
    "3": "Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade. Cook the chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a cutting board to rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "4": "Dice cooled chicken into bite-size pieces. Toss chicken and remaining 2 tablespoons hot sauce together in a bowl.",
    "5": "Brush each naan with olive oil; cook on the grill until golden and toasted on one side, 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and transfer naan pieces, toasted-side up, to a baking sheet. Spread blue cheese dressing on the toasted side of each naan. Top each with diced chicken and red onion. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese over the top.",
    "6": "Return naan to grill and cook until cheese is melted and bottom is toasted and golden, 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from grill, slice into pieces and top with lettuce and tomato."
