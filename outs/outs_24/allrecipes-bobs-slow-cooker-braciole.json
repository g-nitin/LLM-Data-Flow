    "1": "Pour marinara sauce into the slow cooker and set on High to warm.",
    "2": "Combine eggs and bread crumbs in a small bowl. Sprinkle both sides of the flank steak with salt and pepper. Pat bread crumb mixture over one side of flank steak, leaving a 1-inch border around the edges. Top bread crumbs with bacon slices and sprinkle with shredded cheese. Starting from one long side, tightly roll flank steak into a log. Use string or toothpicks to secure the log in 4 or 5 places.",
    "3": "Heat oil in a heavy skillet. Sear prepared flank steak log in hot oil until well browned on all sides, about 10 minutes; transfer to warm sauce in the slow cooker and spoon sauce over steak log to cover.",
    "4": "Turn slow cooker to Low; cook steak log until very tender, 6 to 8 hours. Remove string/toothpicks before slicing. Serve with marinara sauce."
