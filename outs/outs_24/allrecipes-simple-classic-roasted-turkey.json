    "1": "Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).",
    "2": "Season turkey with salt and pepper and place, breast-side down, in a roaster; add neck and giblets. Pour water into pan.",
    "3": "Bake in the preheated oven, basting as needed, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 6 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Continue to roast until meat falls off the bone if desired."
