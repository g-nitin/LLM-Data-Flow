    "1": "In a saucepan, bring water and bouillon cubes to a boil. Add rice and stir. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 50 minutes, or until rice is tender and all liquid has been absorbed.",
    "2": "Heat oil in a stockpot over medium-high heat. Cook zucchini and onion until tender, but still slightly firm, about 5 minutes. Stir in cumin, oregano, lentils, and about 6 cups water gradually. Bring to a soft boil, and continue cooking until lentils are tender, 45 to 60 minutes, adding water as needed.",
    "3": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
    "4": "Mix the cooked rice together with the lentils, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir in 3/4 of the Cheddar cheese, and transfer mixture into a 9x13 inch pan. Mix remaining cheese together with the breadcrumbs, and spread evenly over the top of the dish.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven just until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes."
