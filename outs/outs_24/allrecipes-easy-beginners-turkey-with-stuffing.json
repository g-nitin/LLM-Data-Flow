    "2": "Remove and discard giblets. Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Place turkey in a shallow roasting pan.",
    "3": "Bring water and 4 tablespoons butter to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in stuffing mix, cover, remove from the heat, and let rest for 5 minutes.",
    "4": "While stuffing is resting, melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add celery and onion; cook and stir until tender, 5 to 7 minutes.",
    "5": "Add celery and onion to the stuffing. Mix in toasted bread pieces and season with salt and pepper.",
    "6": "Loosely scoop stuffing into the body and neck cavities of the turkey. Rub exterior of the turkey with vegetable oil and loosely cover with aluminum foil.",
    "7": "Roast turkey in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C) and the interior of the stuffing reaches 165 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 3 \u00bd to 4 hours. Remove foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking to brown the bird."
