    "1": "In a large bowl, stir together flour, salt, and water until a soft dough is formed. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead briefly. Divide dough into 2-inch diameter balls and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap.",
    "2": "Select one ball of dough and roll out until very thin but not torn. Sprinkle lightly and evenly with sugar. Fold up dough into a small square and roll out again until thin.",
    "3": "Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium heat. Place rolled dough onto the pan and cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute on each side until golden. Serve immediately. Repeat until all dough balls have been rolled and cooked."
