    "1": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour olive oil into hot pan and heat until shimmering. Cook mustard seeds in hot oil until they begin to pop, about 1 minute; immediately add peppercorns and fenugreek seeds.",
    "2": "Gently lay the lamb chops in a single layer into the skillet; add curry sauce and basil and stir. Bring the sauce to a boil, place a tight-fitting lid on the skillet, reduce heat to low, and cook until the lamb is tender, 60 to 70 minutes.",
    "3": "Remove lid from skillet. Continue to cook and stir until most of the liquid has been reduced and the meat has a brownish look on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes more."
