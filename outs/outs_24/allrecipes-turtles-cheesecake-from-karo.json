    "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "2": "Melt 3 tablespoons butter; combine with graham crackers crumbs. Press evenly into bottom of 8 x 8-inch baking pan. Set aside.",
    "3": "Reserve 10 caramels. Microwave remaining caramels, corn syrup and 2 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently until melted. Remove and let cool 5 minutes.",
    "4": "Beat cream cheese and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs one at a time until well blended. Gradually beat in melted caramel mixture. The caramel will cool and streak throughout.",
    "5": "Pour filling over crust. Bake for 32 to 38 minutes until just set. Remove from oven and let cool on rack 10 minutes. Chill for at least 4 hours or overnight. Melt chocolate chips and oil in a microwave-safe bowl for 30 seconds or until melted. Drizzle over cheesecake.",
    "6": "Microwave reserved caramels and cream in a microwave-safe bowl for 1 minute; stir. Continue to microwave in 15 second increments until sauce is creamy. Drizzle over cheesecake and sprinkle with pecans.",
    "7": "Great caramel flavor in a creamy cheesecake."
