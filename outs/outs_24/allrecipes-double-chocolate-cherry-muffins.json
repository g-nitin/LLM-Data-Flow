    "1": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 12 jumbo (3 1/2-inch) muffin cups or line with paper baking cups.",
    "2": "Stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center and set aside.",
    "3": "Whisk together sour cream, milk, vegetable oil, eggs, and almond extract in a separate bowl until evenly blended. Pour sour cream mixture into the well; stir in flour mixture until just combined. Fold in cherries and chocolate chips. Spoon into prepared muffin cups, filling half full.",
    "4": "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in pan on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely on wire rack. Store tightly covered at room temperature."
