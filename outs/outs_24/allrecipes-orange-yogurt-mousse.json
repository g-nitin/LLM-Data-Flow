  "instructions": {
    "1": "In a saucepan, combine orange zest, 1/2 cup cream, sugar, and salt over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and let steep 20 minutes.",
    "2": "Pour orange juice into a medium bowl; sprinkle with gelatin and let soften, 5 minutes. Bring cream and sugar mixture to a simmer again; pour through a fine-mesh sieve onto gelatin, pressing on zest to extract flavor. Discard zest. Whisk until gelatin has dissolved, about 1 minute. Gradually whisk in yogurt. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes, or use quick-chill method (see note, below).",
    "3": "In a medium bowl, with an electric mixer, beat remaining 1 cup cream until soft peaks form. Fold gently into yogurt mixture. Divide among 6 glasses, and cover each with plastic wrap; refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. To serve, sprinkle with pistachios and, if desired, orange zest."
