    "1": "There is enough filling for two meat pies. In a heavy bottom pot, place meat, onion, water, salt and pepper. Bring to the boil and reduce heat to medium. Cook until meat is well cooked, and no pink remains. Add allspice and nutmeg, plus a very small pinch of cloves. Mix well and taste. Add more salt if needed.",
    "2": "Place bottom pie crusts in pie plates. Spread half of the grated potato over each pie crust. Sprinkle with salt. Top with 3 cups (750 mL) of meat mixture. Place second crust over entire mixture. Seal edges and cut vents into top pastry to allow steam to escape.",
    "3": "Bake 8-9 inch meat pie in a 400 degrees F oven for 15 minutes; reduce oven heat to 350 degrees F and bake for another 35 minutes. Remove pie from the oven and allow cooling for 5 minutes prior to cutting and serving."
