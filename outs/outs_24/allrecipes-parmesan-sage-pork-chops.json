    "1": "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.",
    "2": "Mix flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow dish. Place beaten egg in another shallow dish. Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan, sage, and lemon zest in a third shallow dish. Gently press a pork chop into flour mixture to coat, then shake off excess flour. Dip into beaten egg, then press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place breaded pork chop onto a plate while breading the remaining pork chop; do not stack.",
    "3": "Heat olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown pork chops for about 4 minutes per side, then transfer to the prepared baking dish.",
    "4": "Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C),"
