    "1": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut four 12x15-inch sheets of parchment paper. Fold each in half widthwise and reopen.",
    "2": "Mix rice, olives, chicken broth, orange juice, orange zest, salt, and pepper together in a bowl.",
    "3": "Spoon 3/4 cup of the rice mixture onto 1 side of each parchment rectangle, near the crease. Pile shrimp evenly over rice mixture. Drizzle 1 teaspoon olive oil over each pile of shrimp; lay 1 orange slice on top.",
    "4": "Fold empty half of parchment over shrimp filling and crimp edges together with overlapping folds to seal. Arrange packets close together on a sheet pan.",
    "5": "Roast on the center rack of the preheated oven until shrimp are tender and opaque, 15 to 17 minutes. Unfold 1 edge of the parchment, being careful to avoid steam, and look inside to check doneness.",
    "6": "Open packets carefully, being careful to avoid steam. Slide shrimp and rice mixture into bowls. Garnish with almonds and parsley."
