    "1": "In a small pot combine dry grits, 1 1/2 cups water, and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, then simmer until grits are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool.",
    "2": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.",
    "3": "Beat the eggs in a large bowl, then stir in the cooled grits, ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and Asiago cheese. Stir in the garlic powder, parsley, crushed red pepper, and 1 teaspoon salt. Mix well.",

    "5": "Bake in preheated oven until light golden brown, 30 to 40 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving."
