    "3": "Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray; warm over medium-high heat. Cook meatballs in the hot skillet until browned all over. Transfer meatballs to a plate and set aside. (Meatballs do not need to be fully cooked since they will finish cooking in the soup.)",
    "4": "Cook and stir remaining onion in the same skillet over medium-low heat until translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer onions to a large pot.",
    "5": "Pour chicken broth into the pot with onions. Stir in carrots, celery, and potatoes. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer until potatoes are nearly tender, about 15 minutes.",
    "6": "Add meatballs and remaining cilantro; simmer for 30 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper."
