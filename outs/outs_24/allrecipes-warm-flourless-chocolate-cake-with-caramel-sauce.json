  "title": "Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake with Caramel Sauce",
  "instructions": {
    "1": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan; line with parchment paper.",
    "2": "Melt 1 cup butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in chocolate until almost melted. Off heat, stir until melted and smooth. Combine 1 1/4 cups sugar and cocoa powder in a large bowl. Whisk in eggs until well blended; whisk in chocolate mixture. Transfer batter to the prepared pan.",
    "3": "Bake in the preheated oven until edges nicely puffed and surface is firm except for a small center spot that jiggles when pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes. Cool cake in the pan on a wire rack. Run a knife around the sides of the pan to loosen the cake, then remove the sides of the pan, and invert onto a serving plate. Remove parchment paper.",
    "4": "Combine remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar, water, and lemon juice in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Cook, without stirring, until syrup is deep amber in color. (Dip a metal spoon into syrup; lift it out of pan to check color.) Remove from heat; gradually stir in heavy cream. The mixture will bubble vigorously. If lumps form, stir gently over low heat until dissolved. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter.",
    "5": "Cut cake into wedges while warm. Spoon caramel sauce over top to serve."
