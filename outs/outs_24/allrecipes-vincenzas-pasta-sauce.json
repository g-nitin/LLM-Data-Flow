  "instructions": {
    "1": "In a large bowl, combine ground beef, egg, Romano cheese, bread crumbs, parsley, salt, pepper, and water. Mix until well blended. Roll meat mixture into balls about 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch in diameter. Set aside.",
    "2": "Place the pork ribs in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a large stock pot. In the same skillet, cook the sausage until browned. Add to stock pot.",
    "3": "Fill the skillet with a mix of olive oil and vegetable oil to a level about 1 to 2 inches up the side of the pan. Heat over medium-high heat and place meatballs into the oil. Do not attempt to turn the meatballs until they release from the bottom of the pan. You want a nice crusty meatball. Once meatballs are done, add them to the stockpot, too. Pour 4 quarts of tomato puree into the stockpot and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and allow to simmer.",
    "4": "Drain most of the oil out of the skillet, but leaving enough to fry the onion. Heat the oil over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, and continue cooking and stirring until the onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Stir in the can of tomato paste along with 3/4 cup of water, and the final quart of tomato puree into the skillet. Let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, then pour the sauce into stockpot. Simmer until the meats are tender, 1 to 3 hours, stirring occasionally."
