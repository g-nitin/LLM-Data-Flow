    "2": "Cook and stir ground beef in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until meat starts to brown and release its juices, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in poblano peppers, salsa, salt, dried chipotle pepper, and oregano. Cook and stir until beef is crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes.",
    "3": "Meanwhile, whisk one package corn muffin mix in a large bowl with one egg and 1/3 cup of milk until combined; spread into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle corn over top, followed by 1/2 of the Cheddar and 1/2 of the Montery Jack. Spread beef mixture over the cheeses.",
    "4": "Mix remaining corn muffin mix, egg, milk, Cheddar, and Monterey Jack in a bowl; carefully spread over beef mixture to within 1/2 inch of the edges of the dish.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 50 to 60 minutes."
