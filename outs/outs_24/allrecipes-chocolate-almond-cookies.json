    "1": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.",
    "2": "Using the back of a wooden spoon or a spatula, cream together the room temperature butter and the Splenda.",
    "3": "Then add the almond meal and cocoa powder and blend well. No lumps.",
    "4": "Add the beaten egg whites and the extracts and blend well.",
    "5": "Drop about a rounded Tbsp of batter onto a cookies sheet lined with parchment paper. The cookies will pretty much hold whatever shape they are when going into the oven, so experiment. I like them in rugged looking drops but sometimes I flatten them more like a cookie. You can even pipe them out with a pastry bag.",
    "6": "Bake at 375 degrees F for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cool for a few minutes."
