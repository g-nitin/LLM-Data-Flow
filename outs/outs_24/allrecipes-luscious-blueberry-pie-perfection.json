    "1": "Move a rack to the center of the oven and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
    "2": "Stir gingersnap crumbs with light brown sugar and melted butter in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie dish.",
    "3": "Bake the crust on the center rack of the preheated oven just until set, 3 to 4 minutes. Baking too long will make the crust hard to cut. Remove the crust and let cool.",
    "4": "Stir cornstarch and water in a saucepan until smoothly mixed; add sugar and 1 1/2 cups blueberries. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring until the blueberry sauce is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in remaining 2 1/2 cups blueberries and lemon juice.",
    "5": "Pour filling into the gingersnap crust and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 1 hour."
