    "1": "In a mixing bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Add the milk, butter, sugar, salt, lemon extract, eggs and 1 cup flour. Beat until smooth. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface; gently knead for 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to greased top. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight.",
    "2": "Punch dough down. Turn onto a floured surface; divide into four portions. Roll one portion into a 9-in. x 6-in. rectangle (refrigerate remaining portions until ready to roll out). Cut into 3-in. squares.",
    "3": "In a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, milk and vanilla until smooth. Place about 2 teaspoons filling in the center of each square. Moisten corners with water; bring over center of filling and pinch corners tightly in center. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Place seam side up 2 in. apart on greased baking sheets; brush with melted butter. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes.",
    "4": "Bake at 400 degrees F for 10-12 minutes or until lightly browned. Remove from pans to wire racks. Combine icing ingredients; spread over warm buns."
