  "instructions": {
    "1": "Mix flour, seasoned salt, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a shallow plate or bowl. Place eggs in a separate shallow bowl.",
    "2": "Roll or shake chicken pieces in the flour mixture and place on a platter. Then dip each chicken piece in the egg and roll again in the flour mixture.",
    "3": "Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
    "4": "Fry coated chicken pieces in hot oil for about 5 minutes on each side. Cover skillet and cook on lower heat for about 10 minutes. Remove cover, turn up the heat, and fry for 5 minutes on each side to make chicken crispy. Chicken is done when it is no longer pink inside and its juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
    "5": "Drain fried chicken on paper towels and keep warm in an oven until ready to serve."
