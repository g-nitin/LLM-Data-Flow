    "1": "Combine flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, and salt in a food processor; pulse until blended. Add butter; pulse until butter is the size of peas. Pour in water and pulse until dough comes together.",
    "2": "Shape dough into a disc; wrap with plastic wrap. Chill until firm, about 30 minutes.",
    "3": "Cut pluots into thin slices using a mandoline slicer. Place pluot slices, 1/3 cup sugar, cornstarch, and lime juice in a bowl; toss to combine.",
    "4": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "5": "Roll dough out into a 12-inch circle on a floured work surface. Transfer to the baking sheet. Arrange pluot slices in concentric circles over the dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Fold the border up over the pluot slices, pleating to hold slices in. Brush beaten egg over the border.",
    "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until dough is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing."
