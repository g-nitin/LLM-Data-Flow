    "1": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
    "2": "Combine flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a medium bowl. Set aside.",
    "3": "Beat together sugar and butter with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in egg until completely blended, then stir in rhubarb. Mix in flour mixture until just incorporated. Fold in raisins, nuts, and flax seeds, mixing just enough to evenly combine. Drop spoonfuls of dough 2 inches apart onto ungreased baking sheets.",
    "4": "Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely."
