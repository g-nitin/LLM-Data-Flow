    "1": "Brush 2 flat baking sheets with oil. Fill a pie plate with 1 inch of cold water.",
    "2": "In a small, heavy saucepan, combine the sugar, water and corn syrup and bring to a boil, stirring just until the sugar dissolves. Boil over high heat, without stirring, until the syrup reaches 280 degrees F on a candy thermometer, about 20 minutes. Add the cranraspberry concentrate and food coloring and cook over moderately high heat until the syrup reaches 300 degrees F. Briefly dip the saucepan in the cold water to stop the cooking.",
    "3": "Once the bubbling subsides, carefully spoon 6 scant tablespoons of syrup about 2 inches apart on 1 of the prepared baking sheets. Working quickly, place a stick in each of the lollipops, turning it to cover with syrup. Continue to form the lollipops, 6 at a time, until both baking sheets are full. If the syrup in the saucepan becomes too thick, melt it over low heat. Let the lollipops harden, then wrap in plastic."
