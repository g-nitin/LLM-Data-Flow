    "1": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
    "2": "Beat egg with 1 teaspoon garlic powder, salt, and black pepper in a shallow bowl. Combine bread crumbs, remaining 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and Parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl. Set aside.",
    "3": "Combine melted butter and lemon juice in a bowl; pour about 2/3 into bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, tilting dish to completely coat. Spread mushrooms in an even layer in the dish. Dip chicken breasts into egg mixture, lifting up so excess drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumb mixture to coat both sides; place on top of mushrooms. Drizzle remaining butter mixture over chicken breasts; sprinkle with parsley.",
    "4": "Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, about 45 minutes."
