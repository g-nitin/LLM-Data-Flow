  "instructions": {
    "1": "Rinse well the hens. Using good kitchen shears remove the backbone by cutting along each side of it (a sharp knife works well too). Also break the wishbone so that the hens can lie flat. Place hens in a large re-sealable plastic bag with the Italian dressing. Try to remove as much air as possible while sealing the bag closed. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
    "2": "Remove hens from the refrigerator about 10-15 minutes before grill time. Discard marinade.",
    "3": "Pull off the top leaves of the rosemary sprigs and mince. You should have about 1 tsp worth. Reserve the remaining rosemary for step 5.",
    "4": "In a small bowl, place the butter, oregano, thyme and rosemary. Zap in the microwave for about 30 seconds, just enough to melt the butter. Set aside.",
    "5": "Prepare your grill so that you have a heat source on only one side of the grill. Under the grate on the cool side, place the rosemary sprigs reasonably close to the heat but not touching it. Oil the grate and place the hens on the cool side, breasts side up. Cover and cook undisturbed for 15 minutes. (Feel free to start grilling vegetables and/or meats on the hot side after the 15 minutes.)",
    "6": "With a basting brush, start basting the hens with the herb butter mixture every 5 minutes or so for another 15 to 25 minutes keeping the grill covered as much as possible. Check for doneness with an instant read thermometer reading 180 degrees F in the center of the breast; or by twisting the leg bone to see if it can move easily in the joint; or by cutting into the thigh joint where it meets the breast and checking for clear liquid."
