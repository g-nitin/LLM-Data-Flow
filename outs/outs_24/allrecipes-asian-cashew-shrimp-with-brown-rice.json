    "1": "In a medium saucepan, bring the water to a boil. Stir in the rice and season to taste with the salt. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.",
    "2": "In a large bowl, stir together the soy sauce, wine, sesame oil, ginger, and garlic. Add the shrimp and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.",
    "3": "Remove the shrimp from the marinade and set aside. Stir the cornstarch into the marinade until blended well.",
    "4": "In a wok or large nonstick skillet, heat the oil on high heat. Add the onion, water chestnuts, and mushrooms. Cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Add the shrimp, snow peas, and cashews, and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.",
    "5": "Pour in the marinade. Stir for 1 minute, or until the sauce is thickened and the shrimp is cooked through. Serve immediately, spooned over the rice."
