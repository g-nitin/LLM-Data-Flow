    "2": "Cook rice vermicelli per package directions (cooked yield should be about 1 cup). Rinse with cold water and drain.",
    "3": "Soak 1 rice-paper sheet in warm water 30 to 90 seconds or until soft. Carefully transfer to clean towel and blot dry. Place 3 or 4 basil leaves along bottom third of sheet (leaving 1/2\" margin along edges). Layer 1/8 cup of the rice vermicelli on top of basil, followed by 1/8 of the cucumber, carrots, chicken, and mint leaves. Starting from the bottom, roll rice paper around the filling. Fold sides up and continue rolling until roll is sealed completely. Repeat with remaining sheets and filling. Cut each roll in half crosswise and serve with peanut sauce."
