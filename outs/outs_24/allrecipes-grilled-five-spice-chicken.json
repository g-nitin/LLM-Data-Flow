  "instructions": {
    "1": "Score the skin side of each piece of chicken 2 to 3 times, about 1/8-inch deep. Set aside.",
    "2": "To make the marinade: Whisk juice of 1/2 lime, 1 tablespoon fish sauce, garlic, 1 tablespoon rice vinegar, Chinese five-spice powder, 2 teaspoons hot chile paste, ginger, and soy sauce together in a medium bowl until well combined. Pour marinade into a resealable plastic bag; add chicken, coat evenly with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 6 hours.",
    "3": "Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.",
    "4": "Remove chicken halves from the bag and transfer to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Reserve marinade mixture in a small bowl.",
    "5": "Whisk together 1/3 cup rice vinegar, juice of 1/2 lime, 1 teaspoon fish sauce, and 1 teaspoon hot chile paste in a small bowl until well combined. Set aside.",
    "6": "Grill chicken, skin-side down, on the preheated grill for 2 minutes. Turn each piece, brush with reserved marinade mixture, and move to indirect heat.",
    "7": "Grill, brushing with marinade and turning every 10 to 15 minutes, until browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C).",
    "8": "Drizzle vinegar-lime juice mixture over chicken and serve."
