  "instructions": {
    "1": "Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until most of the water has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.",
    "2": "While rice cooks, place snow peas on top of rice and steam, covered, until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer snow peas to a bowl to stop cooking; set aside.",
    "3": "Preheat the oven broiler. Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking dish with aluminum foil and coat with cooking spray.",
    "4": "Arrange salmon fillets on the prepared baking dish. Whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, hot water, and miso in a small bowl until combined; spoon over salmon.",
    "5": "Broil in the preheated oven, basting frequently with soy sauce mixture, until golden brown and fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.",
    "6": "While salmon cooks, make sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Add ginger and shallots; cook and stir until shallots are translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup sake; bring to a boil and cook until reduced by 2/3, about 3 minutes. Add heavy cream; bring to a boil and cook until sauce is reduced by half, about 2 minutes.",
    "7": "Whisk in butter, one cube at a time, until incorporated and sauce is thick and creamy. Remove from heat. Whisk in remaining 1 tablespoon sake and lime juice. Season with salt.",
    "8": "Spoon some sake sauce onto 4 serving plates. Place rice in the middle of each and top with a salmon fillet. Arrange snow peas around each plate. Garnish with chives."
