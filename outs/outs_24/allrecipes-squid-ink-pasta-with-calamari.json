    "1": "Heat avocado oil in a deep skillet over medium heat; cook and stir minced garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in squid and a pinch of salt. Pour 2 cups water and 1 cup wine over squid, ensuring squid is fully submerged. Cover skillet and bring liquid to a boil; reduce heat and simmer until squid is tender, about 40 minutes.",
    "2": "Bring 8 cups generously salted water to a boil in a pot. Cook squid ink pasta at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving pasta water.",
    "3": "Remove squid from skillet and place in a bowl. Add shallot and scallions to skillet; cook and stir in the remaining liquid for about 3 minutes. Stir in butter, a splash of white wine, lemon juice, basil, paprika, dried roasted garlic, Parisian herb blend, salt, and pepper. Slowly pour in cream until sauce reaches desired color and consistency.",
    "4": "Mix squid into the sauce and cook until sauce reduces and thickens, about 5 minutes. Add some of the reserved pasta water if sauce gets too thick. Add pasta to sauce; toss to coat lightly with sauce."
