    "2": "Place the shredded pork in a bowl, and season with garlic salt, salt, and pepper. Mix in the Cheddar cheese and onion.",
    "3": "Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place equal amounts of the pork mixture in the center of each corn tortilla, and fold in half to form tacos. One or two at a time, cook the tacos in the hot oil until golden brown."
