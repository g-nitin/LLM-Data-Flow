    "1": "Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).",
    "2": "Remove fat from pork; cut meat into 2-inch cubes and roughly chop fat.",
    "3": "Mix together pork meat and fat with garlic, olive oil, orange peel, orange juice, salt, bay leaves, black pepper, cumin, cinnamon, and 5-spice powder in a large bowl until pork is coated completely.",
    "4": "Transfer mixture to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover the dish tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil, then place on a baking sheet.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven until pork is fork tender, about 3 1/2 hours.",
    "6": "Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Remove garlic, orange peel, and bay leaves from the baking dish. Transfer pork to a colander set in a bowl. Pour accumulated juices from the baking dish over pork. Return pork to the baking dish and drizzle with some accumulated juices.",
    "7": "Cook under the preheated broiler for 3 minutes. Drizzle more accumulated juices over pork and continue broiling until crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pork to a serving plate and drizzle with remaining accumulated juices.",
