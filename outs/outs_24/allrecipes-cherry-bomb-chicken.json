    "3": "Combine cherry tomatoes, habanero peppers, garlic, and allspice with sugar and salt mixture in a blender; blend until smooth.",
    "4": "Pour tomato brine over chicken pieces, making sure all pieces are covered. Cover bowl or container; refrigerate 4 to 6 hours.",
    "5": "Transfer chicken pieces from brine to a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels, shaking off excess. Pat chicken pieces dry with more paper towels. Discard brine.",
    "6": "Preheat an outdoor grill for high, indirect heat and lightly oil the grate.",
    "7": "Combine oil, thyme, cumin, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a small bowl; brush onto chicken pieces",
    "8": "Cook chicken, skin sides down, on the preheated grill for 1 to 2 minutes; flip chicken and move to indirect heat. Cook until well-browned and meat is no longer pink in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
    "9": "Brush chicken pieces with chili sauce; transfer to a plate and rest 10 minutes before serving."
