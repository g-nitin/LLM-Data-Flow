    "3": "Steam broccoli in the microwave according to package directions until crisp-tender, 4 to 6 minutes.",

    "5": "Spread cooked rice into the bottom of a casserole dish. Top rice with shredded chicken. Spread soup mixture over chicken, then sprinkle with Cheddar.",
    "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until slightly browned on top, 35 to 45 minutes."
