    "1": "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F.",
    "2": "Make stuffing: Toast bread cubes on baking sheet until dry and beginning to brown on edges, about 15 minutes. (Leave oven on.)",
    "3": "Cook celery, onion, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper in 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl.",
    "4": "Heat remaining 2 tablespoons butter in cleaned skillet over high heat until foam subsides, then saute livers with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper until edges are browned but livers are still pink inside, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and cool completely, then cut livers into 1/4-inch dice.",
    "5": "Whisk together eggs and milk in a large bowl, then stir in bread, vegetable mixture, livers, dill, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Let stand at room temperature until bread has absorbed liquid, about 10 minutes.",
    "6": "Prepare veal: Trim as much excess fat as possible from veal, then lay meat on a work surface. Beginning at center of thickest edge of veal breast, insert a large knife horizontally into center of veal and cut a pocket as evenly as possible, leaving a 1-inch border on 3 sides. Open pocket and sprinkle inside with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Fill pocket with stuffing and cover opening with bacon slices. Rub outside of veal with oil and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.",
    "7": "Transfer veal to a small roasting pan. Add stock to pan, then cover pan tightly with foil and roast veal 1 1/2 hours.",
    "8": "Remove foil and baste veal with stock, then roast, uncovered, until well browned and thermometer inserted diagonally 2 inches into stuffing registers 190 degrees F, about 1 hour more.",
    "9": "Transfer veal to a platter and let stand, loosely covered with foil, 20 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature."
