    "1": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Soak toothpicks in a bowl of water. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.",
    "2": "Mix soy sauce and ground ginger together in a bowl. Place brown sugar into a separate bowl. Spread open a pitted date, then stuff it with a smoked almond. Wrap date with half a bacon slice; secure with a toothpick, then dip the bundle in soy sauce mixture, then into brown sugar. Place wrapped dates into the prepared baking dish. If desired, sprinkle a little more brown sugar over the bundles.",
    "3": "Bake in the preheated oven until the bacon is brown and crisp, 15 to 25 minutes. Allow to cool for about 15 minutes before serving; serve warm or at room temperature."
