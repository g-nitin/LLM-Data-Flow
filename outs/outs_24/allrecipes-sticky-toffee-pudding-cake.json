    "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.",
    "2": "In a small bowl combine the dates and baking soda. Pour enough boiling water over the dates to just cover them.",
    "3": "Beat 1/3 cup of butter with white sugar in a bowl with an electric mixer until light and frothy. Beat in eggs and mix well to combine.",
    "4": "Add flour and date mixture (including water) to the egg mixture and fold to combine. Pour cake batter into the prepared baking dish.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, 30 to 40 minutes. Let cake cool slightly while you prepare the toffee sauce.",
    "6": "To make the toffee sauce: Combine brown sugar, 1/3 cup butter, and evaporated milk in a small saucepan; cook over medium heat and bring to boil. Turn heat down and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Pour toffee sauce over individual servings of warm cake."
