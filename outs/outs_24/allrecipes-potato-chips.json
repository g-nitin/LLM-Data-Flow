    "1": "Lightly grease a large dinner plate with cooking spray; set aside.",
    "2": "Pour oil into a plastic bag (a produce bag works well). Add potato slices and shake to coat. Arrange potato slices in a single layer on the prepared plate.",
    "3": "Cook in the microwave on high until lightly browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove chips to a large bowl and toss with salt. Chips will crisp as they cool. Repeat with remaining potato slices; no need to grease the plate again."
