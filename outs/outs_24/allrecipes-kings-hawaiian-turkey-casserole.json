  "instructions": {
    "1": "Place bread, turkey and cheese in a large bowl, blend with a large spoon gently.",
    "2": "In another bowl, whisk eggs. Add flour to egg mixture and continue to whisk till blended. Then add mustard, melted butter, milk, salt and pepper. Whisk thoroughly.",
    "3": "Pour milk mixture over the bread, turkey and cheese; stir gently to blend (be careful not to over-stir as the bread can become overly moist and break apart).",
    "4": "Let stand for five to ten minutes for bread to absorb liquid.",
    "5": "Pour into a buttered 2-quart baking dish.",
    "6": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 50 minutes (should be lightly golden and puffed). Test with a knife inserted into center - it should come out clean with little liquid on the knife.",
    "7": "For a lighter dish, consider using low-fat mild Cheddar cheese and low-fat milk."
