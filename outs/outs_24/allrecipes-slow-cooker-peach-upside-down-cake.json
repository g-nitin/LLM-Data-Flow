  "title": "Slow Cooker Peach Upside-Down Cake",
  "instructions": {
    "1": "Spread peach slices between several layers of paper towels and let dry, gently pressing occasionally and replacing any soaked towels, about 20 minutes.",
    "2": "Meanwhile, pour melted butter over the bottom of a 6-quart oval slow cooker. Stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small bowl until well combined and sprinkle over butter.",
    "3": "Arrange peaches in a tight layer over brown sugar. (You may need to make a partial second layer to fit them all in.)",
    "4": "Beat softened butter with white sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in almond extract.",
    "5": "Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate bowl. Working in batches, stir flour mixture into egg mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Mix until batter is well combined, then spoon over peaches and spread evenly. Drape paper towels over the top of the slow cooker to absorb any condensation during baking.",
    "6": "Cover and cook on High until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 2 hours to 2 hours and 30 minutes.",
    "7": "Remove the lid and paper towels. Using oven mitts, remove the ceramic liner from the slow cooker and let cool for 10 minutes. Run a knife around the edge of cake and carefully turn out onto a serving platter."
