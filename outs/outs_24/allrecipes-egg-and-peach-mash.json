  "instructions": {
    "1": "Steam or boil diced peaches until very tender. Drain if necessary and mash or puree until you have your desired consistency. Let cool slightly then place in a sealed container in the fridge until ready to use.",
    "2": "Place your egg in a small pot and cover with cold water. The water should be about an inch or so higher than the egg. Cover the pot with a lid. Over high heat, bring your egg to a rolling boil.",
    "3": "Remove from heat and let stand for 12 minutes.",
    "4": "Drain water and immediately run cold water over egg until cooled. Rapid cooling helps prevent a green ring from forming around the yolks.",
    "5": "Peel egg and place in a bowl. Mash very well.",
    "6": "Combine egg with 1/4 cup (60 mL) pureed peaches and mashed banana. Mash together well until you have your desired consistency. Add a little breast milk or formula to thin if you like."
