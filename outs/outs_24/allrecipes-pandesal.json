    "1": "Combine milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and yeast in a large bowl; stir until sugar and yeast are fully dissolved, about 5 minutes.",
    "2": "Mix remaining sugar, flour, and salt together in a large bowl. Pour in milk mixture and vegetable oil. Mix until dough comes together.",
    "3": "Turn dough out onto a flat work surface. Knead until smooth. Shape into a ball and return to the bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled, at least 1 hour.",
    "4": "Divide dough into 4 equal portions using a bench knife. Roll each portion into a log; slice diagonally into 1-inch pieces.",
    "5": "Pour bread crumbs onto a large plate. Roll each piece of dough in bread crumbs and place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Let rise until puffy, 30 to 45 minutes.",
    "6": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
    "7": "Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes."
