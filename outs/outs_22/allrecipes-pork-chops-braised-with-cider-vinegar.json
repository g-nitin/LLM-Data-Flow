    "1": "Pour oil into a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. When hot, add pork chops and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 4 minutes total. Transfer to a plate. Add onion and garlic to pan. Stir frequently until onion is limp, about 5 minutes.",
    "2": "Stir in vinegar, soy sauce, and honey, and return pork chops to pan. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until pork chops are barely pink in center (cut to test), 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "3": "Place each pork chop on a plate and top equally with onion mixture. Add salt and pepper to taste."
