    "1": "Whisk the pudding and 2 cups milk together in a bowl until thickened, about 2 minutes. Refrigerate the pudding until serving time.",
    "2": "Mix blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar in a large saucepan, and pour in enough water to just barely cover the berries. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, reduce heat to low, and simmer while you make the biscuits.",
    "3": "To make drop biscuits, mix flour, baking powder, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and salt together in a bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture, and pour in vegetable oil and 1 cup of milk. Stir until the mixture forms a soft dough.",
    "4": "Bring the berry mixture back to a boil, and drop the biscuit dough into the boiling blueberries by heaping spoonfuls. Cover, and simmer over medium-low heat until the biscuit dough is cooked through, about 15 minutes. A knife inserted into a dumpling will come out clean. To serve, scoop a biscuit into a serving bowl, spoon blueberry sauce over, and top with chilled vanilla pudding."
