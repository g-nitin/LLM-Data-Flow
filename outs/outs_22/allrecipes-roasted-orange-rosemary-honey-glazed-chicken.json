    "1": "Sprinkle chicken with salt and place in a large glass or plastic bowl.",
    "2": "Whisk together honey, orange juice with pulp, butter, rosemary, orange zest, garlic, and pepper in a separate bowl. Pour orange mixture over chicken; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to overnight.",
    "3": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
    "4": "Place chicken in a single layer in a roasting pan; pour orange mixture over chicken.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Baste chicken with pan juices and reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C). Continue basting chicken every 20 minutes and cook until chicken is a deep orange-brown color, no longer pink at the bone, and the juices run clear, about 90 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat near the bone should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C)."
