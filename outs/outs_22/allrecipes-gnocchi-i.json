    "1": "Gather the ingredients.",
    "2": "Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with 2 inches of salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-high and simmer, undisturbed, until tender but still firm, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain potatoes and place back in the pot to dry and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "3": "As soon as potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel potatoes by rubbing skins off with your hands. Pass peeled potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl (alternatively, mash until very smooth.) Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.",
    "4": "Fold in flour, egg, and salt until flour is incorporated and dough starts to hold together. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead once or twice until mostly smooth (do not overwork).",
    "5": "Divide dough into 4 even portions. Roll and shape each portions of the dough into long \"snakes,\" about \u00be-inch in diameter.",
    "6": "Cut snakes into about 1/2-inch long pieces. (Optional: Roll each piece against the tines of a fork or a gnocchi board to make light ridges.) Transfer shaped gnocchi to a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet dusted with flour.",
    "7": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high. Working in batches, drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; transfer cooked gnocchi with a spider or slotted spoon to desired sauce.",
    "8": "Serve and enjoy!"
