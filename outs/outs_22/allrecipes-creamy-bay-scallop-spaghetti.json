    "1": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; add spaghetti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.",
    "2": "Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.",
    "3": "Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic.",
    "4": "Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.",
    "5": "Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.",
    "6": "Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.",
    "7": "Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls."
