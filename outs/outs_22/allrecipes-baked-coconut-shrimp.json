    "1": "Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat a baking sheet with cooking spray.",
    "2": "Rinse shrimp; pat dry with paper towels.",
    "3": "Combine cornstarch, salt, and cayenne pepper in a shallow bowl. Add coconut flakes to a separate shallow bowl. Beat egg whites in a third shallow bowl until foamy.",
    "4": "Dredge 1 shrimp in cornstarch mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg whites. Left up so excess drips back into the bowl. Press into coconut to completely coat. Place coated shrimp, unstacked, on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining shrimp.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven until outsides bright pink, centers opaque and no longer transparent, and coconut is browned, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping shrimp halfway through.",
    "6": "Enjoy!"
