    "1": "Bring a large pot of water to a boil; add apples briefly, using a slotted spoon, to remove any wax that may be present. Wipe dry; set aside to cool. Insert sticks into apples through cores.",
    "2": "Place unwrapped caramels and 2 tablespoons water into a microwave-safe medium bowl. Cook on High for 2 minutes; stir. Continue cooking and stirring at 1 minute intervals until caramel is melted and smooth.",
    "3": "Line a baking sheet with waxed paper; coat with cooking spray. Hold apples by sticks; dip into caramel to coat. Set on waxed paper; refrigerate to set, about 15 minutes.",
    "4": "Microwave chocolate and 1 tablespoon shortening in a microwave-safe bowl until melted and smooth. Dip apples into chocolate to cover caramel layer; return to waxed paper to set.",
    "5": "Place candy melts and remaining 1 tablespoon shortening in a micro-wave safe bowl; microwave, stirring every 30 seconds, until smooth. Use a fork or wooden stick to drizzle melted candy melt in a colorful design onto coated apples. Refrigerate until set, overnight is better."
