    "1": "Thaw the pastry sheet at room temperature for 40 minutes or until it's easy to handle. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Lightly grease or line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Stir the egg and water with a fork in a small bowl.",
    "2": "Unfold the pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface. Roll the sheet into a 13x11-inch rectangle. Place on the prepared sheet. Brush the edges of the rectangle with the egg mixture. Fold over the edges 1/2 inch on all sides, pressing firmly with a fork to form a rim. Prick the pastry thoroughly with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.",
    "3": "Stir the oil and garlic in a small bowl. Place the eggplant, zucchini and squash in a single layer on a shallow-sided pan. Brush with the oil mixture. Turn vegetables over and brush with more oil. Season to taste. Bake the vegetables 4 minutes, turning halfway through cooking. Cool slightly.",
    "4": "Spread the pesto on the pastry. Arrange the vegetables alternately in rows. Sprinkle with the cheese.",
    "5": "Bake for 20 minutes or until golden. Sprinkle with the red pepper. Serve immediately."
