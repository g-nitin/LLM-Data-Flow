    "1": "Place the eggs in a saucepan of cold water, bring to a boil, and boil gently for 10 minutes. Drain the eggs and cool under cold running water. Set aside.",
    "2": "While the eggs are cooking, heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic, and saute for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the ground coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, and chilies (if using). Stir for 1 minute.",
    "3": "Add the pinto beans or chickpeas and apricots, and stir to coat them with the spices. Stir in the bulgur and green beans, then pour in enough water to cover by about 1/2 inch. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes, or until all of the liquid has been absorbed.",
    "4": "While the bulgur is cooking, shell and slice the eggs. Fluff the bulgur with a fork and season lightly with salt and pepper. Serve hot, garnished with the egg slices and sprinkled with cilantro leaves."
