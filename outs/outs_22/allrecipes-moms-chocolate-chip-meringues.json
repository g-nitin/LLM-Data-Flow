    "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a cookie sheet or line with parchment paper.",

    "3": "Gently fold in chocolate chips using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Using a teaspoon, drop batter onto prepared cookie sheet. Place in the oven, and turn off heat. Leave in the oven at least 4 hours, or overnight for even better results."
