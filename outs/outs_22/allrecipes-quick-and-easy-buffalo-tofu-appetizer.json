  "instructions": {
    "1": "Place tofu onto a plate and place another plate on top. Set a 3 to 5 pound weight on top; press tofu until water is extracted and tofu is firmer, about 15 minutes. Drain and discard the accumulated liquid. Slice tofu into 1-inch wide by 4-inch long pieces.",
    "2": "Whisk egg in a small bowl. Pour breadcrumbs into separate shallow bowl. Dip tofu pieces into beaten egg and press into bread crumbs. Gently toss between your hands so any bread crumbs that haven't stuck can fall away. Place the breaded tofu pieces onto a plate while breading the rest; do not stack.",
    "3": "Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry tofu in a single layer, browning completely on each side before turning, about 3 minutes per side. Place fried tofu on serving platter.",
    "4": "Combine hot pepper sauce and butter in a bowl; pour over fried tofu. Serve with blue cheese dressing and celery pieces."
