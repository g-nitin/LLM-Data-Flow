  "instructions": {
    "1": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
    "2": "Cut a pocket into the side of each piece of chicken, going to within 1/2 inch of each edge. Season chicken pieces with salt and pepper; set aside.",
    "3": "Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and chicken livers; cook and stir until onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and sage; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Pour in the chicken broth and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat. Gently stir in the cornbread crumbs and set aside until cool enough to handle.",
    "4": "Spoon some of the stuffing into the pocket of each piece of chicken. Arrange them in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon any leftover stuffing into the pan to surround the chicken. Stir together the condensed chicken soup and water; pour over the top of the chicken. Cover with a lid or aluminum foil.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove the aluminum foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the center of the stuffed breasts reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) and the chicken has browned on top."
