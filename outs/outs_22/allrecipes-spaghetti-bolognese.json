    "1": "Make the sauce: Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Drain grease.",
    "2": "Add mushroom to the pot; cook and stir until it begins to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in condensed soup and diced tomatoes. Reduce the heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Stir in the following ingredients, one at a time, stirring well after each addition: Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, Cajun seasoning, seasoning blend, lemon juice, garlic, basil, salt, pepper, and vanilla. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.",
    "3": "After the sauce has simmered for about 15 minutes, make the pasta: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add spaghetti and oil; boil until pasta is cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.",
    "4": "Serve sauce over pasta."
