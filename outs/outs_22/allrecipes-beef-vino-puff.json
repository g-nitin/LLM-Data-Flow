  "instructions": {
    "1": "Preheat oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source.",
    "2": "Place beef tenderloin filets in a broiler pan and broil until slightly browned but still very rare, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the filets and set aside to rest; reduce heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).",
    "3": "Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat and cook and stir shallot and garlic until the shallot is translucent, about 5 minutes.",
    "4": "Pour in Pinot Noir, bring to a boil, and cook until sauce is reduced by half, about 10 minutes, stirring often. Stir in garlic salt and Italian seasoning. Reduce heat to low.",
    "5": "Slowly stir cream cheese into the sauce until you get a creamy purple sauce. Remove the sauce from the heat.",
    "6": "Place puff pastry sheets on a work surface and cut each sheet in half crosswise.",
    "7": "Spoon a generous amount of sauce onto a puff pastry sheet half, and center a tenderloin filet onto the sauce.",
    "8": "Fold the puff pastry sheet over the steak and sauce, and press the edges all the way around to seal. Repeat with remaining steaks. Place the pastry-covered steaks onto a baking sheet.",
    "9": "Whisk the egg white and water in a bowl and brush the mixture over the tops of the pastry.",
    "10": "Bake in the oven until the pastry is browned and puffed and the steaks are the desired degree of doneness, about 25 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of the meat should read at least 145 degrees F (65 degrees C)."
