  "instructions": {
    "1": "I prefer to use frozen spinach just because it is easier, but if you want to use fresh (just steam it in a covered skillet with a tiny bit of water). In either case; save the liquids that are formed to add to the recipe.",
    "2": "Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and place in a bowl; set aside. (Wash up well before preceding).",
    "3": "In a large skillet or a soup pot, melt the butter over medium-high heat. I suggest searing the chicken in two batches. Add just 1/2 Tbsp of the curry powder and 1/2 of the chicken. Stir-fry until all sides of the chicken pieces have been seared. Transfer to a bowl and then add another 1/2 Tbsp of the curry powder and the remaining chicken. Sear and then transfer to the bowl.",
    "4": "I usually just eat this by itself. But if I have guests, then I usually broil an assortment of veggies that I tossed with canola oil and some coriander, garlic powder and lemon pepper (see page 198)."
