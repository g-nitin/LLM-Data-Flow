    "1": "Combine shallots, ginger, olive oil and SPLENDA\u00ae in a medium saucepan. Sweat shallots and ginger over low heat until soft and shallots are translucent. Turn up heat and add vinegars.",
    "2": "Cook until mixture reduces by 1/3 then stir in a solution of water mixed with corn starch and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add mustard. After dressing cools, strain out ginger and shallots.",
    "3": "Toss all remaining ingredients together in a large salad bowl except for blackberries and duck breast. Dress salad with candied ginger vinaigrette and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide evenly onto 8 chilled salad plates. Slice duck breast and fan 3-4 oz of duck around each salad. Drizzle remaining vinaigrette onto duck breast and garnish with a few blackberries."
