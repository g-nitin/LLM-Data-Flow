    "1": "Place chicken wings and onion in a soup pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for 20 minutes.",
    "2": "Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). While the wings are cooking, combine the soy sauce, cinnamon, cloves and ginger in a saucepan, and warm over medium heat. When chicken is done, drain water (may be reserved for other uses as a broth), and pour in the soy sauce mixture. Stir to coat all of the wings, then place them in a single layer on a cookie sheet.",
    "3": "Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the outsides are crispy. Baste with sauce as desired while cooking."
