    "1": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a 1 1/2-quart baking dish with cooking spray.",
    "2": "Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the rigatoni and return to a boil. Stirring occasionally, boil until the pasta cooked is still firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink; pour into the prepared baking dish.",
    "3": "Place a skillet over medium heat; crumble the sausage and lamb into the hot skillet. Breaking the meat into small pieces with a wooden spoon, cook and stir the mixture until completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the fat from the skillet.",
    "4": "Pour about half of the tomato sauce over the pasta, then layer with the provolone slices and the meat mixture. Season with the Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper; top with the mozzarella cheese and the remaining tomato sauce. Sprinkle the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over the top of the dish.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven until hot and bubbly, 25 to 35 minutes."
