    "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.",
    "2": "In a small sauce pan, cover the unpeeled garlic cloves with water. Bring to a boil and cook garlic cloves for 15 minutes; drain, cool, mash and set aside.",
    "3": "Place the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden, about 10 minutes; cool and set aside.",
    "4": "In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes, green onions, shredded Provolone, rosemary, black pepper and toasted pine nuts.",
    "5": "In a medium mixing bowl, cream together the shortening and the sugar. Mix in the eggs, mashed garlic, reserved oil from the tomatoes and buttermilk.",
    "6": "Add the shortening/buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture and stir well to combine. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan.",
    "7": "Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then turn onto a wire rack to cool completely."
