    "1": "Cut carrots into narrow 4-inch sticks. Blanch in boiling water 2 minutes. Immediately immerse in cold water; drain. Place in a large glass bowl.",
    "2": "Slice round mango cheeks from pit (save trimmings to eat later). Cut into long, thin strips (similar in size to carrots). Place in bowl with carrots and whole garlic cloves.",
    "3": "Combine minced garlic, salt, vinegar, water, and sugar in a non-aluminum saucepan; bring just to a boil. Remove from heat and pour hot liquid over carrots and mango sticks. Cool to room temperature. Transfer to jars with tight lids and refrigerate 1 hour (or longer) before serving."
