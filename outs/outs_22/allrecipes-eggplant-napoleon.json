    "1": "Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).",
    "2": "Whisk eggs together in a bowl. Place bread crumbs into another bowl.",
    "3": "Peel eggplant; cut into twelve 1/3-inch-thick slices. Dip each slice into eggs; lift up so excess drips back into the bowl. Press into bread crumbs until both sides are evenly coated.",
    "4": "Spray a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Working in batches, cook breaded eggplant slices until crispy on the bottom, 2 to 4 minutes. Spray the tops with cooking spray, then flip and cook until eggplant is tender and the other side is browned, 2 to 4 minutes more. Transfer to a plate.",
    "5": "Arrange six eggplant slices in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Top each slice with several basil leaves, one tomato slice, and one mozzarella slice; cover with remaining eggplant slices.",
    "6": "Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is softened, but not melted, 5 to 10 minutes."
