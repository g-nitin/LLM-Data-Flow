  "instructions": {
    "1": "Prepare cold outdoor gas grill by lifting grate and placing a drip pan directly on the flavorizer bars, ceramic briquettes, or lava rocks. Replace grate. Spray cold grate and cooking utensils well with cooking spray. Heat grill for Indirect Heat Cooking according to manufacturer's recommendation. Preheat burners on HIGH for 10 to 15 minutes with lid closed.",
    "2": "Remove plastic netting and wrapper from turkey roast. Leave string netting on roast. Drain juices; pat dry with paper towels. Lift string netting and shift position on roast for easier removal after cooking. Spray roast with cooking spray to prevent drying.",
    "3": "Turn grill temperature down to medium; maintain a 350 degrees F temperature in the covered grill. Place turkey roast on cooking grate over the drip pan. Close lid and cook with minimal peeking. Turn the turkey over when one-half done to ensure both sides cook evenly. Cook for 1 1/2 hours or to an internal temperature of 170 degrees F. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.",
    "4": "Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; add onion, red bell pepper, and garlic; cook about 8 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is soft and liquid has evaporated. Blend in remaining ingredients; stir until heated through. Serve over grilled turkey."
