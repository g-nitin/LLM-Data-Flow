    "1": "Gather all ingredients.",
    "2": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 cups hot pasta water, then drain macaroni in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to cool; set aside.",
    "3": "Pour reserved pasta water into the same pot and add lobster halves, cut-side up. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and steam until lobster meat firms and turns opaque, about 3 minutes.",
    "4": "Remove lobster to a tray and cool for a few minutes, then remove lobster meat and cut into bite-sized pieces. Reserve shells.",
    "5": "Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until onion is softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove onions to a small bowl; set aside.",
    "6": "Place reserved lobster shells, milk, shallot, peppercorns, and garlic into the same saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat and cook for 20 minutes.",
    "7": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
    "8": "Melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture turns pasty and light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Strain milk mixture through a mesh sieve and slowly pour into flour mixture while whisking. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook and stir until thick and smooth, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.",
    "9": "Stir Gruy\u00e8re, Cheddar, and Romano cheeses into thickened milk mixture until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in reserved lobster meat, onions, and macaroni.",
    "10": "Pour mixture into a 4-quart casserole dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle evenly with panko crumbs.",
    "11": "Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes."
