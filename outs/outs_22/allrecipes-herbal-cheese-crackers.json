    "1": "In a small bowl, toss together the cheese and herbs.",
    "2": "Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Sprinkle two or three little circles of the cheese blend, about 1 heaping Tbsp worth. Allow to heat until the edges start to turn a light golden brown, then flip with a spatula. Brown the other side. Then transfer to a paper towel and repeat with remaining cheese.",
    "3": "The cracker is easy to mold as soon as it comes out of the skillet. Lay them on top of spice jars or shot glasses to form a nicely curved cracker great for stuffing."
