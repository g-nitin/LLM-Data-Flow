    "1": "Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Spray 15x10x1-inch pan with CRISCO\u00ae Original No-Stick Cooking Spray. Unroll pizza crust dough in pan; press dough to edges of pan. Bake 7 to 12 minutes or until light golden brown. Cool 5 minutes.",
    "2": "Meanwhile, in 10-inch skillet, cook bacon over medium heat, turning once, until crisp. Remove bacon from skillet; drain on paper towels.",
    "3": "In small bowl, make apricot aioli by stirring mayonnaise and preserves until well mixed. Set aside.",
    "4": "Cut pizza crust in half crosswise to make 2 rectangles. Remove rectangles from pan; spread half of the apricot aioli evenly over each rectangle. Top 1 rectangle evenly with turkey, bacon and cheese. Add other rectangle, aioli side down. Cut large sandwich in half crosswise; cut each in half diagonally to make 4 sandwiches.",
    "5": "Heat 12-inch skillet over medium heat until hot. Place 2 sandwiches in skillet. Place smaller skillet or saucepan on sandwiches to flatten slightly; keep skillet on sandwiches while cooking. Cook 1 to 4 minutes on each side or until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown. Remove from skillet; cover with foil to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 2 sandwiches. Garnish with parsley sprigs."
