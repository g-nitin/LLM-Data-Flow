  "instructions": {
    "1": "Rinse frog legs and pat dry; set aside. Combine flour, cornmeal, saltine cracker crumbs, pepper, salt, and onion in a large resealable bag; shake well to mix. Whisk eggs and milk together in a shallow bowl.",
    "2": "Heat vegetable oil and peanut oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should be about 1/2 inch deep.",
    "3": "Dip legs into egg mixture in batches, then press into cracker mixture until evenly coated. Place the breaded legs, unstacked, onto a plate. Repeat with remaining legs.",
    "4": "Lower breaded legs carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining frog legs."
