  "instructions": {
    "1": "Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium heat in a large saucepan. Add 3 whole garlic cloves; cook until brown and fragrant, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove garlic cloves; set aside. Add pig's feet and pork neck bones to the saucepan; cook, turning occasionally, until meat and bones have browned, about 15 minutes.",
    "2": "Return garlic cloves to saucepan; stir in 1 1/2 cups water and tomato paste. Bring to a boil; add tomato pur\u00e9e. Reduce heat to low; simmer until pig's feet are tender and mixture begins to thicken, about 3 hours, stirring often from the bottom to prevent burning. Stir in sugar, black pepper, and baking soda; simmer while preparing meatballs.",
    "3": "Soak torn bread in a bowl with remaining 1 cup water; squeeze excess water from bread. Place bread in a large bowl. Add ground pork, ground veal, ground beef, and 6 beaten eggs; mix thoroughly and form into 24 meatballs about 2 1/2-inches in diameter.",
    "4": "Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, stir in basil and minced garlic; cook about 1 minute. Add meatballs, working in batches, if necessary; season with salt and black pepper. Cook on all sides until brown, about 15 minutes.",
    "5": "Add meatballs, oil, basil, and minced garlic to sauce, gently stirring to avoid breaking meatballs. Add 6 whole hard-boiled eggs; simmer until meatballs are cooked, sauce is thick, and flavors have blended, about 1 1/2 hours."
