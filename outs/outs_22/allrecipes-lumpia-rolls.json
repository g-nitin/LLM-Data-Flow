    "1": "Brown beef and pork in a large frying pan with a small amount of oil over medium heat. Drain, place in a large mixing bowl, and set aside. In the same pan, cook the carrots with a splash of soy sauce until tender. Add the bean sprouts, snap peas, mushrooms, and green onions, and a dash each of soy sauce, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper. Cook and stir for 5 minutes, or until vegetables are tender but still firm. Add to beef and pork, and toss to combine.",
    "2": "Work with 5, or so, spring roll wrappers at one time, leaving the others covered with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out. Lay the wrappers so that one corner is facing you. Place a small amount of filling mixture on the corner closest to you, and fold over. Fold the two outside corners inward, then continue rolling up as you would a burrito, leaving the top corner exposed. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top corner, finish rolling, and seal. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers.",
    "3": "Heat vegetable oil in deep-fryer or deep skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry rolls for about 5 minutes, or until golden brown, then drain on paper towels."
