    "1": "Tint the frosting orange and set aside.",
    "2": "Use 1/2 cup of orange frosting to spread on the bottom of both pound cakes, then press them together. Stand the cakes up so that they are vertical on a serving plate.",
    "3": "Create the pitch of the roof by trimming the top of one cake on a slight angle to give it the appearance of looking tipsy. Trim the other cake on a steeper angle. Completely cover the cake with remaining orange frosting. Break the chocolate wafers in half and arrange, overlapping slightly, as the roof.",
    "4": "Using the photograph as a guide, pipe black decorating icing for the windows and other decorations. Use 3 TWIX Cookie Bars as the door and chimney. Use broken wafer cookies for the shutters. Use M&M'S Brand Peanut Chocolate Candies to outline the top of the roof and sides of the house.",
    "5": "Grind the remaining cookies along with remaining TWIX Cookie Bars in the food processor. Spread this mixture around the base of the house as 'dirt.' Scatter M&M'S Brand Chocolate Candies on the cookie 'dirt.'"
