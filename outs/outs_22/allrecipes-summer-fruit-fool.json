    "1": "Reserve about 2 ounces of the mixed fruit for decoration. Put the remaining mixed fruit in a saucepan with 2 tablespoons water. Bring just to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until soft and very juicy, about 5 minutes. Stir in the sugar.",
    "2": "Remove from the heat and leave to cool slightly. Pour into a food processor or blender and puree. Press the puree through a fine nylon strainer to remove all the seeds. Alternatively, just press the fruit through a fine nylon strainer to puree it; set aside to cool completely.",
    "3": "Whip the cream with the grated orange zest until thick. Add the yogurt and lightly whip into the cream, then stir in the cooled fruit puree.",
    "4": "Spoon into 4 dessert dishes or goblets. Chill well before serving, decorated with the reserved berries and orange zest, if you like."
