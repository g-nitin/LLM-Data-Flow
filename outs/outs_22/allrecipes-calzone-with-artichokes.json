    "1": "Divide the pizza dough into 4 equal pieces.",
    "2": "Preheat the oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F for 30 minutes.",
    "3": "Place a large saute pan over high heat.",
    "4": "Add the olive oil and when it is hot, saute the artichoke hearts and mushrooms.",
    "5": "Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "6": "Pour off any excess oil and let the vegetables cool.",
    "7": "Roll or stretch the dough, 1/4 at a time, into 9-inch circles.",
    "8": "Place the dough circles, one at a time, on a lightly floured wooden peel.",
    "9": "Brush the circles to within 1-inch of the edge with chili oil.",
    "10": "For each calzone, put 1/4 of both cheeses on half of the dough, still leaving the 1-inch border.",
    "11": "Top with 1/4 of the artichokes and mushrooms, the garlic and the thyme.",
    "12": "Assemble the remaining calzones in the same way.",
    "13": "Moisten the edges of the circles with water.",
    "14": "Fold the un-topped half of the dough, trapping as much air inside as possible, over the filling and press the edges together firmly to seal.",
    "15": "With the backside of a fork, press the edges of the dough to crimp them.",
    "16": "Slide the calzones onto the pizza stone and bake about 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown.",
