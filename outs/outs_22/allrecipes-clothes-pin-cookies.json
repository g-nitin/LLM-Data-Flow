    "1": "Mix 1/4 pound of the butter with 3 cups of flour, 2 tablespoons white sugar, egg yolks, and water. (Done like making pie dough with a pastry blender.)",
    "2": "Chill for 1 hour then roll out like pie dough on a floured pastry sheet. Spread another 1/4 pound of the butter over dough. Fold dough together and refrigerate 1 hour. Repeat this procedure until all of the butter is used.",
    "3": "Cut dough into fourths. Wrap each quarter in plastic wrap. Chill.",
    "4": "Take out one quarter at a time and allow to stand at room temperature long enough that it softens enough that the dough can be rolled.",
    "5": "Roll dough out on floured pastry sheet/ board. Cut dough into 1/2 inch wide X 4-5 inch long strips. Wrap around clothes pins or dowel pins pinching ends.",
    "6": "Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned. Slide off sticks while still very warm and then cool completely.",
    "7": "To Make Filling: In a saucepan over medium heat, cook 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup flour until thick stirring constantly. Let cool.",
    "8": "Cream together shortening, confectioners' sugar, marshmallow cream, and vanilla. Add cooked mixture to creamed mixture and beat till fluffy. Fill cooled pastry curls with filling."
