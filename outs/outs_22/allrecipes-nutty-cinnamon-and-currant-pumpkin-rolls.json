  "instructions": {
    "1": "Combine milk and 3 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave until butter is just melted and milk is warmed (120 degrees F/49 degrees C to 130 degrees F/54 degrees C), 30 to 60 seconds.",
    "2": "Mix pumpkin, white sugar, and salt together in a bowl; beat in egg and yeast. Stir milk mixture into pumpkin mixture until evenly combined.",
    "3": "Whisk all-purpose flour and bread flour together in a bowl and divide mixture in half. Beat 1/2 the flour mixture into the pumpkin mixture on low until well mixed, about 5 minutes. Add remaining flour mixture and beat until dough is very soft.",
    "4": "Turn dough into a bowl that has been greased or sprayed with cooking spray; lightly grease or spray dough. Cover bowl with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm area until dough is doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
    "5": "Grease or spray an oblong baking sheet with cooking spray.",
    "6": "Punch the risen dough down and turn onto a well floured work surface; knead until dough is smooth and easy to handle, 1 to 2 minutes. Roll dough into a 10x12-inch rectangle and brush top with melted butter. Sprinkle cinnamon, brown sugar, pecans, and currants, respectively, onto the butter layer. Roll dough, beginning with long side, around filling in a jelly roll fashion and pinch the other side onto the roll to seal. Cut roll into 12 slices.",
    "7": "Arrange rolls, cut-side up, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a towel and let rise until nearly doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.",
    "8": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).",
    "9": "Remove towel from rolls and bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden, about 20 minutes.",
    "10": "Beat cream cheese and 1/2 cup butter together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth; beat in confectioners' sugar and vanilla extract until icing is fluffy and smooth. Spread icing on pumpkin rolls."
