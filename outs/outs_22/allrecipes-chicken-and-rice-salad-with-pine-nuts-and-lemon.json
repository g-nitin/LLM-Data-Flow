  "instructions": {
    "1": "In a small frying pan, toast the pine nuts over moderately low heat, stirring frequently, until they are golden brown, about 5 minutes. Or toast the pine nuts in a 350 degrees F oven for about 8 minutes.",
    "2": "In a small glass or stainless-steel bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Add the oil slowly, whisking.",
    "3": "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the peas; cook until just barely tender, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or a strainer, transfer to a large bowl. Add the rice to the water and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, return to the pot, and cover to keep warm.",
    "4": "Meanwhile, in a large frying pan, bring 1/4 inch of water to a simmer over moderately high heat. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper and add to the pan. Cover, reduce the heat, and simmer, turning once, until cooked through, about 12 minutes. Remove the chicken, let cool slightly, and then cut into approximately 1/2-inch chunks.",
    "5": "Add the pine nuts, rice, chicken, raisins, scallions, parsley, lemon zest, and dressing to the large bowl and stir gently to mix."
