    "1": "Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.",
    "2": "Spread the bread cubes in a thin layer onto two or more baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until the bread cubes have toasted evenly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir once as the bread bakes. Once toasted, place the bread cubes into a very large mixing bowl and set aside.",
    "3": "Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the pork sausage. Cook and stir until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain the sausage and add to the bread cubes.",
    "4": "Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in the same skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and celery, and cook until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with sea salt and pepper, and scrape into the bowl with the bread cubes. Stir in the apples, cranberries, walnuts, sage, rosemary, thyme, and parsley. Whisk the eggs in a bowl along with the chicken stock, and pour over the bread mixture along with 1/2 cup of melted butter. Stir well until the bread cubes have absorbed the chicken stock. Pack into the prepared 9x13 inch baking dish and cover with aluminum foil.",
    "5": "Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, then remove the aluminum foil, and stir the stuffing. Return to the oven and continue baking until golden brown on top, about 15 minutes more."
