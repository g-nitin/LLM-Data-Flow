    "1": "Grease two 9-inch pie plates and set aside.",
    "2": "Make pastry: Pulse flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a food processor several times until combined. Add cold butter and pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add egg and vanilla; process until dough holds together, about 30 seconds.",
    "3": "Transfer dough to a well-floured work surface, divide in half, and roll each piece into a 9-inch round crust. Fit crusts into the prepared pie plates and freeze for 1 hour.",
    "4": "Make filling: Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan; stir in rice and return to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook until rice has absorbed water, about 20 minutes.",
    "5": "Stir milk into rice and bring to a simmer; cook until thickened, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.",
    "6": "Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).",
    "7": "Beat together ricotta cheese, eggs, sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in cooled rice mixture and crushed pineapple until thoroughly combined.",
    "8": "Divide filling between frozen pie crusts.",
    "9": "Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set and the tops are golden brown, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Cool on wire racks."
