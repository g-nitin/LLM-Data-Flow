    "1": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a fluted tube pan such as a Bundt\u00ae pan.",
    "2": "Combine the cake mix and pudding mix in a bowl. Thoroughly whisk together the sour cream, vegetable oil, eggs, water, and 1/4 cup frosting in a separate bowl, then stir into the cake and pudding mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared tube pan.",
    "3": "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 50 to 55 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. Frost the cooled cake with the remaining strawberry frosting."
