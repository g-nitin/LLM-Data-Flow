  "instructions": {
    "1": "Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter in a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add shrimp and cook, stirring often, until they are just opaque in center (cut to test), 4 to 5 minutes. Remove shrimp from pan and keep warm.",
    "2": "Melt remaining butter in pan. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook, stirring often, until onion is soft but not browned, about 3 minutes. Blend in flour and cook, stirring, until bubbly. Remove from heat and gradually stir in broth, whisking to prevent lumps.",
    "3": "Return to heat and cook, stirring often, until sauce boils and thickens. Stir in sour cream, catsup, chopped dill, and shrimp. Stir just until heated through; do not boil.",
    "4": "Remove from heat and season to taste with salt and pepper. Place fettuccine in a large serving bowl and top with stroganoff. Garnish with dill sprigs."
