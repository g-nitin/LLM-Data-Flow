    "1": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a large rimmed baking sheet with olive oil.",
    "2": "Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, mozzarella cheese, egg, and garlic in a medium bowl; mix well. Use a 1/4 cup measure or ice cream scoop to portion into 12 to 13 meatballs. Place on the prepared baking sheet.",
    "3": "Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a meatball should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).",
    "4": "Bring sauce to a simmer in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Place cooked meatballs into sauce and simmer for 10 minutes.",
    "5": "Place hot pasta into a large bowl. Ladle some sauce over hot pasta; toss to coat. Serve with more sauce and meatballs; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese."
