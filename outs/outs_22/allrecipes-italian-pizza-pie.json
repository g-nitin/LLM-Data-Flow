    "1": "Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.",
    "2": "Combine 4 cups flour with 1 cup shortening. Add in 2 eggs and 1/2 cup cold water to make the crust. Separate dough into 2 portions, one for top and one for bottom. Roll bottom crust and place in the bottom of a 12x15 inch baking pan.",
    "3": "When you buy the cold cuts you will buy them in chunk form. Dice each chunk into small pieces. Meanwhile cook pasta until almost done.",
    "4": "When you're through cutting the cold cuts place them in a large mixing bowl. Place the cooled pasta on top. In a separate bowl beat 12 eggs. Add a little pepper to taste. Pour the eggs on top of cold cut mixture. Mix ingredients with your hands or a large spoon if you prefer.",
    "5": "Place in the prepared bottom crust. Roll out the top crust and make 3 slits for air in the top. Place on top and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour. ENJOY!"
