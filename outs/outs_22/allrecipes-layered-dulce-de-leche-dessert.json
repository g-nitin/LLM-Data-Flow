Spoon one third of the pudding mixture over wafers in pan; top with 12 of the remaining wafers and 2 Tbsp. of the caramel topping. Repeat layers of pudding mixture, wafers and caramel topping. Cover with the remaining pudding mixture. Sprinkle with chopped wafers; press wafers gently into pudding mixture.",
