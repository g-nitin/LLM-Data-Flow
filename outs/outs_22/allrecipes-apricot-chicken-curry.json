    "1": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Season chicken with salt and pepper.",
    "2": "Heat oil in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and red pepper flakes; cook and stir until garlic is soft and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add chicken and brown for about 3 minutes per side.",
    "3": "Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",
    "4": "Bring apricot nectar to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat, then reduce then heat to medium-low. Mix water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; stir into apricot nectar. Stir in curry powder, then apricots. Add baked chicken.",
    "5": "Place the cast iron skillet with chicken drippings over medium heat. Stir in carrots, onion, bell pepper, and chile pepper; cook and stir until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken and apricot sauce into the skillet; cover and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Season again with salt and pepper. Stir in water chestnuts just before serving."
