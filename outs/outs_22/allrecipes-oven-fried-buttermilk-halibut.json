  "instructions": {
    "1": "Set a large resealable plastic bag in a bowl. Pour in the buttermilk and salt. Add the halibut fillets and close the bag. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 1 day.",
    "2": "Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).",
    "3": "Place half of the crackers and half of the Greek seasoning into a blender. Cover and pulse until they become fine crumbs. Pour into a shallow bowl, and repeat with remaining crackers and Greek seasoning. Whisk eggs with water in a separate bowl.",
    "4": "Remove halibut from the bag and discard the marinade. Dip fish into the egg and then in the crumbs until evenly coated. Place coated fillets into a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Do not let them touch, as they will weld themselves together. Drizzle the butter on top of the fish.",
    "5": "Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 45 minutes."
