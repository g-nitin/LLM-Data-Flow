2025-05-07 11:05:34.976 | INFO     | __main__:main:391 - The script filtered the initial entity list (e.g., removing items starting with verbs) and then found a subset where *most* question types meet the target count based on a simple text-mention heuristic.
2025-05-07 11:05:34.976 | INFO     | __main__:main:394 - Types like 'Interval Analysis' and 'Concurrency Analysis' were ignored during this check because the heuristic is unreliable for them (questions often don't mention specific entities).
